# Meal Tracking System - Modular Architecture

This directory contains the modular components for the Meal Tracking System.

## Component Structure

1. **Core Components:**
   - `MealEntryDialog.kt` - Main entry point for meal creation/editing (implemented)
   - `CategorySelectionScreen.kt` - First screen of meal entry flow for selecting meal category (implemented)
   - `FoodSearchScreen.kt` - Second screen of meal entry flow for searching and adding food items (implemented)
   - `ReviewScreen.kt` - Final screen of meal entry flow for reviewing and saving meal (implemented)
   - `MealLoggerCardNew.kt` - Enhanced card displaying meal summaries on the Health Screen (implemented)

2. **UI Components:**
   - `FoodSearchBar.kt` - Modern search component with suggestions, barcode and voice input buttons (implemented)
   - `FoodItemCard.kt` - Reusable card for displaying food items with expandable details (implemented)
   - `NutritionSummaryView.kt` - Visual summary of nutritional information with animated charts (implemented)
   - `MealCategorySelector.kt` - UI for selecting meal categories with icons and colors (implemented)
   - `NutrientBar.kt` - Animated progress bar for nutrient visualization (implemented)
   - `PortionSizeSelector.kt` - Visual portion size selection component

3. **Animation Components:**
   - `MealAnimations.kt` - Reusable animations for meal tracking components (implemented)
   - `RevealEffects.kt` - Staggered reveal animations for food items

4. **Functional Components:**
   - `BarcodeScanner.kt` - Barcode scanning using CameraX and ML Kit (implemented)
   - `VoiceInputHandler.kt` - Voice input processing using Android's SpeechRecognizer (implemented)
   - `NutritionCalculator.kt` - Utility for calculating nutritional values

5. **Data Components:**
   - `NutritionApiService.kt` - Interface for external nutrition API with mock implementation (implemented)
   - `LocalFoodDatabase.kt` - Room database for local caching of food data (implemented)
   - `FoodSearchRepository.kt` - Repository handling food search and meal operations (implemented)

6. **Integration Components:**
   - `MealEntryDialogIntegration.kt` - Bridges MealEntryDialog with NutritionViewModel (implemented)
   - `MealLoggerCardIntegration.kt` - Provides EnhancedMealLoggerCard for the Health Screen (implemented)
   - `AddMealFab.kt` - Floating action button for adding meals (implemented)

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with core components and ensure they work properly
2. Implement UI components with modern Material 3 design
3. Add animations and transitions for a polished experience
4. Integrate functional components for advanced features
5. Connect data components for real-world food information

## Current Status

- ✅ UI Components: Basic UI components have been implemented with Material 3 design
- ✅ Build Errors: Fixed all build errors in repositories and Room database
- ✅ FocusRequester: Fixed crash in FoodSearchScreen related to FocusRequester
- ✅ Animation Performance: Optimized animation delays for better responsiveness
- ⚠️ Integration: MealEntryDialog and MealLoggerCard are integrated but not fully functional
- ❌ Functional Components: Barcode scanning and voice input are not working yet
- ❌ Nutrition Data: Not connected to a real nutrition API, only using mock data
- ❌ Custom Food: Cannot add custom food with custom portion sizes and nutrition values
- ❌ Data Display: Saved meals are not appearing in the Health Screen

## Next Steps - Prioritized

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Critical)
1. Fix data persistence and retrieval to show saved meals in the Health Screen
2. Connect to real nutrition API (USDA FoodData Central or Nutritionix)
3. Implement working barcode scanner integration for food lookup
4. Add voice input functionality for food search
5. Implement custom food creation with nutrition value input

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
6. Add portion size customization with nutrition value scaling
7. Implement meal templates and favorites functionality
8. Add meal insights and analytics features
9. Create meal planning functionality

### Phase 3: Polish and Testing
10. Add loading indicators and error handling throughout the flow
11. Improve UI/UX with additional animations and transitions
12. Optimize database queries and API calls for performance
13. Thoroughly test all components for performance and edge cases
14. Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
